### Directory & File Descriptions

- **environments/**
  - Contains isolated Terraform configurations for each environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
  - Each environment folder typically includes:
    - `main.tf`: The root configuration, referencing modules and resources for that environment.
    - `variables.tf`: Input variables specific to the environment.
    - `outputs.tf`: Outputs exported from this environment.
    - `<env>.tfvars`: Variable values for this environment, keeping secrets and settings separate.
  - **Purpose:** Enables safe, independent deployments and testing for each environment.

- **modules/**
  - Houses reusable infrastructure components (modules) such as `compute`, `network`, and `data`.
  - Each module contains:
    - `main.tf`: The core logic for the module (e.g., EC2 setup in compute, VPC in network).
    - `variables.tf`: Inputs to parameterize the module.
    - `outputs.tf`: Outputs from the module, making it composable.
  - **Purpose:** Promotes DRY principles, simplifies maintenance, and enables rapid scaling or changes.

- **.github/workflows/**
  - Contains GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD automation.
    - `terraform-deploy.yml`: Main workflow for deploying infrastructure using Terraform.
    - `terraform-prereq.yml`: Ensures required AWS backend resources (S3, DynamoDB) exist before deployment.
  - **Purpose:** Automates testing, planning, and deployment, ensuring consistency and reliability.

- **Other files**
  - `README.md`: Quick start, basic usage, and essential commands.
  - `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`: In-depth documentation (this file), suitable for onboarding, knowledge sharing, and blog posts.

### How This Structure Helps
- **Modularity:** Modules can be reused across environments or even projects.
- **Environment Isolation:** Each environment is a self-contained folder, reducing risk of cross-environment changes.
- **Scalability:** Adding a new environment or module is straightforward.
- **CI/CD Ready:** Workflows are decoupled from code, making automation easy to extend.

## What Infrastructure Does This Project Create?

This project provisions a robust, production-ready AWS environment, including:

- **Networking (VPC, Subnets, Routing):**
  - Each environment (dev, staging, prod) gets its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets (public/private), route tables, and gateways, ensuring secure and isolated networking.
- **Compute (EC2, Autoscaling):**
  - Modular compute resources such as EC2 instances, with optional autoscaling groups and security groups, can be easily added or modified.
- **Data (S3, DynamoDB):**
  - S3 buckets for remote state and other storage needs, with encryption and versioning enabled by default.
  - DynamoDB tables for Terraform state locking and other application requirements.
- **IAM (Roles, Policies):**
  - Secure, least-privilege IAM roles and policies for all resources, following AWS best practices.
- **Extensible Modules:**
  - The architecture supports adding RDS, Lambda, API Gateway, and other AWS resources as modules with minimal changes.

All resources are parameterized, so you can customize names, sizes, and settings per environment.

## Why Use the Module Approach?

Terraform modules are like functions in programming—they let you define, reuse, and compose infrastructure patterns. Here’s why this approach is superior to monolithic or copy-paste Terraform code:

- **Reusability:**
  - Modules encapsulate best-practice configurations for resources (e.g., a secure VPC setup) and can be reused across environments or even projects.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Updates or bug fixes to a module (e.g., improving security group rules) can be made in one place and instantly reflected everywhere the module is used.
- **Scalability:**
  - Need to add a new environment? Just copy the environment folder and point it at the same modules.
  - Need to add a new resource type (e.g., RDS)? Create a new module and reference it where needed.
- **Testing and Quality:**
  - Modules can be tested independently, ensuring reliability before integrating into environments.
- **Collaboration:**
  - Teams can work on different modules or environments in parallel without conflicts.
- **DRY Principle:**
  - Eliminates copy-paste errors and reduces code duplication, making your infrastructure codebase much cleaner and easier to audit.

**In summary:**
The module-based approach brings the same rigor and flexibility to infrastructure as modern software engineering practices, making your cloud environments robust, consistent, and easy to evolve.

## Quick Start

**1. Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-module-infra.git
cd terraform-module-infra
```

**2. Configure your environment:**
- Edit the relevant `*.tfvars` file in `environments/dev`, `environments/staging`, or `environments/prod` with your settings.

**3. Initialize and deploy:**
```sh
terraform -chdir=environments/dev init
terraform -chdir=environments/dev plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
terraform -chdir=environments/dev apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

Or, use the GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment (see below).

## Automated Deployments with GitHub Actions

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a cornerstone of modern infrastructure management. This project comes with a robust, modular GitHub Actions workflow that automates your Terraform operations for any environment.

### Key Workflow Files
- `.github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml`: The main workflow that runs Terraform commands (init, plan, apply, destroy) based on user input.
- `.github/workflows/terraform-prereq.yml`: A reusable workflow that checks for and creates required backend resources (S3 bucket, DynamoDB table) before any deployment.

### How the CI/CD Workflow Works

1. **Triggering the Workflow:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab on GitHub.
   - Select the "Terraform Deploy" workflow.
   - Click "Run workflow" and choose:
     - The target environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
     - The Terraform action (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy`).

2. **Pre-Deployment Checks:**
   - The workflow first runs `terraform-prereq.yml` to ensure the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for remote state and locking exist. If not, they are created automatically.
   - This prevents state management errors and ensures safe, concurrent operations.

3. **Terraform Execution:**
   - The workflow sets up AWS credentials using GitHub secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`).
   - It checks out the code, installs Terraform, and runs the selected action (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy`) in the specified environment directory.
   - All commands are parameterized so you can safely target any environment.

4. **State Management:**
   - Terraform uses the remote S3 backend with DynamoDB locking, so state is always consistent and protected from concurrent changes.

5. **Audit & Output:**
   - All workflow runs are logged in GitHub Actions, providing a full audit trail for every infrastructure change.
   - Output from Terraform (plan, apply, etc.) is visible in the Actions UI, making it easy to review and debug.

### Benefits of This Approach
- **Safety:** Backend checks and locking prevent state corruption.
- **Repeatability:** Every deployment follows the same, tested process.
- **Transparency:** All changes are logged and reviewable in GitHub.
- **Flexibility:** Easily target any environment or action with a simple UI.
- **Security:** Secrets are never exposed in code or logs.

**In summary:**
The CI/CD workflow enables you to manage infrastructure as code with confidence, speed, and best-in-class practices—no manual steps or risky ad-hoc commands required.

## Remote State Setup (S3 & DynamoDB)

To safely manage Terraform state and locking, set up an S3 bucket and DynamoDB table:

**For PowerShell users:**
```powershell
# Create S3 bucket (replace with your unique bucket name)
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket terraform-module-infra-state --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2

# Enable bucket encryption
aws s3api put-bucket-encryption --bucket terraform-module-infra-state --server-side-encryption-configuration '{\"Rules\":[{\"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault\":{\"SSEAlgorithm\":\"AES256\"}}]}'

# Create DynamoDB table for state locking
aws dynamodb create-table --table-name terraform-locks --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --region us-west-2
```

**For bash users:**  
(You can use the same commands, but you don't need to escape the inner quotes.)

**After setup, re-initialize Terraform:**
```sh
terraform -chdir=environments/dev init
terraform -chdir=environments/staging init
terraform -chdir=environments/prod init
```

---

## Best Practices Used

- **Modularization:** All resources are defined as reusable modules.
- **Environment Parity:** Each environment is isolated for safe testing and deployment.
- **State Management:** Remote backend with locking to prevent concurrent changes.
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions for repeatable, auditable deployments.
- **Security:** AWS credentials are never hardcoded; use environment variables or GitHub secrets.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **S3 Bucket Creation Error:**  
  If you see `IllegalLocationConstraintException`, ensure you use the `--create-bucket-configuration` flag for regions outside `us-east-1`.
- **DynamoDB Table Already Exists:**  
  If you see `ResourceInUseException`, the table is already present—no further action needed.

## How to Use Modules in This Project

### Example: Using the Compute Module
```hcl
module "compute" {
  source        = "../../modules/compute"
  ami_id        = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = module.network.subnet_id
  tags          = var.tags
}
```

### Example: Using the Network Module
```hcl
module "network" {
  source            = "../../modules/network"
  vpc_cidr          = var.vpc_cidr
  subnet_cidr       = var.subnet_cidr
  availability_zone = var.availability_zone
  tags              = var.tags
}
```
